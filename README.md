# predicators

## Repository Description

This codebase provides a concrete implementation of [Neuro-Symbolic Relational Transition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14074) for task and motion planning. **Several features are concurrently under active development -- please contact <tslvr@mit.edu> and <ronuchit@mit.edu> before attempting to use it for your own research.**

The scope of this codebase extends far beyond the scope of the paper linked above. In particular, this codebase aims to ultimately provide an integrated system for learning the ingredients of search-then-sample task and motion planning. That includes: options, predicates, operators, and samplers.

### Code structure

In `src/`, the environments are defined in the `envs/` directory, and the approaches (both learning-based and not) are defined in the `approaches/` directory. The core NSRT learning algorithm happens in `src/nsrt_learning.py`, which has the following steps:
* Segment data based on changes in predicates.
* Learn how many NSRTs we need, along with the symbolic operator components of each (parameters, preconditions, and effects).
* Learn options and annotate data with them.
* Learn samplers.
* Finalize the NSRTs.

Methods for predicate learning are implemented as Approaches (e.g., `src/approaches/grammar_search_invention_approach.py`), and may interface with the core structure of `src/nsrt_learning.py` in various ways. Meanwhile, sampler learning and option learning are implemented in `src/sampler_learning.py` and `src/option_learning.py` respectively.

A simple implementation of search-then-sample task and motion planning is provided in `src/planning.py`. This implementation uses the "SeSamE" strategy: SEarch-and-SAMple planning, then Execution.

## Installation
### Pip
* This repository uses Python versions 3.8+.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

## Instructions For Running Code
### Locally
* (recommended) Make a new virtual env or conda env.
* Make sure the parent of the repository is on your PYTHONPATH.
* Run, e.g., `python src/main.py --env cover --approach oracle --seed 0` to run the system.

### Running Experiments on Supercloud
* Log into supercloud (ask Rohan if you don't know how to do this).
* Go into the `predicators` folder and `git pull` if necessary.
* Edit `./analysis/run_supercloud_experiments.sh` as desired, and run that script to launch parallelized jobs.
* Monitor with `squeue -u ronuchit`, or cancel jobs with `scancel -u ronuchit` (standard Slurm commands).
* When all jobs are done, run `python analysis/analyze_supercloud_experiments.py` (still on supercloud) to print out the results table.

## Instructions For Contributing
* You can't push directly to master. Make a PR and merge that in.
* To merge a PR, you have to pass 3 checks, all defined in `.github/workflows/predicators.yml`.
* The unit testing check verifies that tests pass and that code is adequately covered. To run locally: `pytest -s tests/ --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=src/ --cov=tests/ --cov-fail-under=100 --cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered`, which will print out the lines that are uncovered in every file. The "100" here means that all lines in every file must be covered.
* The static typing check uses Mypy to verify type annotations. To run locally: `mypy . --config-file mypy.ini`. If this doesn't work due to import errors, try `mypy -p predicators --config-file predicators/mypy.ini` from one directory up.
* The linter check runs pylint with the custom config file `.predicators_pylintrc` in the root of this repository. Feel free to edit this file as necessary. To run locally: `pytest . --pylint -m pylint --pylint-rcfile=.predicators_pylintrc`.
* In addition to the packages in `requirements.txt`, please `pip install` the following packages if you want to contribute to the repository: `pytest-cov>=2.12.1` and `pytest-pylint>=0.18.0`. Also, install `mypy` from source: `pip install -U git+git://github.com/python/mypy.git@9a10967fdaa2ac077383b9eccded42829479ef31`. (Note: if [this mypy issue](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5485) gets resolved, we can install from head again.)

### Keeping up Formatting and Stylistic Conventions
This repository follows a number of code formatting and style conventions beyond those checked by the linter to streamline development. To make it easy for developers to adhere to this, we provide a way to auto-format your code with [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) and [docformatter](https://github.com/myint/docformatter). While the use of these autoformatters is not necessary, it is highly recommended, especially to make the PR review process easier (as an added benefit, use of these hooks should make it easier to pass the linter check!). To use these locally, simply:

1. install them:
    1. `pip install yapf`
    1. `pip install docformatter`
1. from **the root of the repo** call them on the file of your choice:
    1. `yapf -i <path-to-file>`
    1. `docformatter -i <path-to-file>`
