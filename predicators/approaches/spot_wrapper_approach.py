"""An approach that wraps a base approach for a spot environment. Detects when
objects have been "lost" and executes a specific controller to "find" them.
Passes control back to the main approach once all objects are not lost.

Assumes that some objects in the environment have a feature called "lost" that
is 1.0 if the object is lost and 0.0 otherwise. This feature should be tracked
by a perceiver.

For now, the "find" policy is represented with a single action that is
extracted from the environment.
