"""A simulator-free planning approach that uses a bridge policy to compensate
for lack of downward refinability.

Like bilevel-planning-without-sim, the approach makes an abstract plan and then
greedily samples and executes each skill in the abstract plan. If at any point
the skill fails to achieve its operator effects, control switches to a bridge
policy, which takes the current state (low-level and abstract) and the last
failed skill identity and returns a ground option or raises BridgePolicyDone.
If done, control is given back to the planner, which replans. If the bridge
policy outputs a ground option, that ground option is executed until
termination and then the bridge policy is called again.

The bridge policy is so named because it's meant to serve as a "bridge back to
plannability" in states where the planner has gotten stuck.
