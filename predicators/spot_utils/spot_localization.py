"""Interface for localizing spot in a previously mapped environment.

The main point of this code is to provide a consistent world frame within and
between runs. That way, absolute positions of objects that are saved in task
files remain accurate, even when starting the robot from a different location.

Before using this interface, follow instructions from the 'Mapping' section
of the README file under the spot_utils folder.
