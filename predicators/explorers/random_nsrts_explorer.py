class RandomNSRTsExplorer(BaseExplorer):
    """RandomNSRTsExplorer implementation.

    Similar to RandomOptionsExplorer in that it chooses
    uniformly at random out of whichever ground NSRTs are
    applicable in the current state, but different in that
    the continuous parameter of the parameterized option is
    generated by the NSRT's sampler rather than by sampling
    uniformly at random from the option's parameter space.

    This explorer is intended to be used when learning options
    via reinforcement learning with oracle samplers. In this
    setting, planning (e.g. using BilevelPlanningExplorer) is
    not feasible because refinement is slow or fails when the
    learned options aren't good enough yet.

    Note that the sampler requires the current low-level state
    as input. An alternative approach would generate a plan of
    options by planning towards the goal with the ground NSRTs
    and avoid refinement by (1) inferring the terminal low-level
    state of each option (the initial low-level state of the
    subsequent option) from the option's sample, which is
    proposing a low-level subgoal, and (2) setting the simulator
    state directly to that state. Because applying dimensionality
    reduction techniques on the sample makes this approach infeasible,
    and this is something we may want to do, we avoid this approach
    for now.
