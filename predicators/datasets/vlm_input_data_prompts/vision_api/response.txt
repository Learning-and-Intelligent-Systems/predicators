The knob's angle changes from 0.0 to -0.4 between state 0 and state 1, suggesting the predicate `IsTurnedOn`. This predicate would be true if the angle of the knob is within a certain threshold of a target angle, indicating that the knob has been turned on.

```python
def IsTurnedOn_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    knob = objects[0]
    threshold = 0.3
    target_angle = -0.4
    return abs(state.get(knob, "angle") - target_angle) < threshold

name: str = "IsTurnedOn"
param_types: Sequence[Type] = [knob_type]
IsTurnedOn = Predicate(name, param_types, IsTurnedOn_holds)
```

The kettle's y position changes from 0.4 to 0.6 between state 1 and state 2, suggesting the predicate `OnBurner`. This predicate would be true if the kettle's position is within a certain tolerance of the burner's position, indicating that the kettle is on the burner.

```python
def OnBurner_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    kettle, burner = objects
    tolerance = 0.1
    return all(abs(state.get(kettle, "x") - state.get(burner, "x")) < tolerance,
               abs(state.get(kettle, "y") - state.get(burner, "y")) < tolerance)

name: str = "OnBurner"
param_types: Sequence[Type] = [kettle_type, surface_type]
OnBurner = Predicate(name, param_types, OnBurner_holds)
```

Although not explicitly changing in the given states, the gripper's pose suggests the predicate `GripperOpen`. This predicate would check if the gripper's quaternion values correspond to an open state.

```python
def GripperOpen_holds(state: State, objects: Sequence[Object]) -> bool:
    gripper = objects[0]
    # Assuming open state corresponds to specific quaternion values
    open_orientation = [0.0, 0.7, 0.7, 0.0] 
    return all(abs(state.get(gripper, "q" + i) - open_orientation[i]) < 0.1 for i in range(4))

name: str = "GripperOpen"
param_types: Sequence[Type] = [gripper_type]
GripperOpen = Predicate(name, param_types, GripperOpen_holds)
```
