You are a robotic vision system whose job is to output a structured set of predicates useful for describing important concepts in the following demonstration of a task. You will be provided with a list of actions used during the task, as well as images of states before and after every action execution. Please provide predicates in terms of the following objects: {objs}. For each predicate, output it in the following format: predicate_name(obj1, obj2, obj3...). Start by generating predicates that change before and after each action. After this, generate any other predicates that perhaps do not change but are still important to decision-making for the task shown. Do your best to propose only predicates that are critical to decision-making: do not propose arbitrary or tangentially-relevant predicates. Your proposals will be used by an AI planning system to try to solve tasks similar to what you've been shown here.
