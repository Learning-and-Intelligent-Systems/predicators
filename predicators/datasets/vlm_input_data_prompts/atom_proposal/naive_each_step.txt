You are a robotic vision system whose job is to output a structured set of predicates useful for running a task and motion planning system from the following scene. Please provide predicates in terms of the following objects: {objs}. For each predicate, output it in the following format: predicate_name(obj1, obj2, obj3...) (for instance is_sliced(apple), is_not_sliced(apple), etc.). Also, for each predicate you list, list its negation. List as many predicates as you can possibly think of, even if they're only tangentially relevant to what you see in the scene and even if they're false, given the following scene taken from a demonstration for the task.Do not list any other text other than the names and arguments of predicates. List each proposal as a bulleted list item on a separate line.
