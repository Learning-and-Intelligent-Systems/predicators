You are a robotic vision system whose job is to output a structured set of predicates useful for describing the important concepts from the following demonstration. Please provide predicates in terms of the objects: {objs}. For each predicate, output it in the following format: predicate_name(obj1, obj2, obj3...) (for instance is_sliced(apple), is_not_sliced(apple), etc.). Also, for each predicate you list, list its negation. Generate as many predicates as you can possibly think of, even if they're only tangentially relevant to the task goal: 'make a cup of ice tea'Do not list any other text other than the names and arguments of predicates. List each proposal as a bulleted list item on a separate line.
