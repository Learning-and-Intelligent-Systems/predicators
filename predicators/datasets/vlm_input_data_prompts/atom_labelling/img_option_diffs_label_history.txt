You are a vision system for a robot. You are provided four images. The first two images correspond to the states before and after a particular skill is executed (the first image is the before image, the second image is the after image). The second two images just close crops of the first two images that make it easier to see the objects most relevant to the action that was taken, which are the objects in the skill's arguments. The third image is the crop of the first image, and the fourth image is the crop of the second image. You are given a list of predicates below, and you are given the values of these predicates in the image before the skill is executed. Your job is to output the values of the following predicates in the image after the skill is executed. Pay careful attention to the visual changes between the before and after images to figure out which predicates change and which predicates do not change. For the predicates that change, list these separately at the end of your response. First, output a description of what visual changes you expect to happen based on the skill that was just run, explicitly noting the skill that was run. Second, output a description of what visual changes you see happen between the before and after images, looking specifically at the objects involved in the skill's arguments. Next, output each predicate value in the after image as a bulleted list with each predicate and value on a different line. For each predicate value, provide an explanation as to why you labelled this predicate as having this particular value. Use the format: <predicate>: <truth_value>. <explanation>.
