You are a vision system for a robot. You are provided with two images corresponding to the states before and after a particular skill is executed. You are given a list of predicates below, and you are given the values of these predicates in the first scene. Your job is to output the values of all the predicates in only the final scene. Pay careful attention to the changes between the two images to figure out which predicates change and which predicates do not change. For the predicates that change, list these separately at the end of your response. Note that in some scenes, there might be no changes. Output each predicate value as a bulleted list with each predicate and value on a different line. For each output value, provide an explanation as to why you labelled this predicate as having this particular value. Use the format: <predicate>: <truth_value>. <explanation>.
