You are a vision system for a robot provided with two images: a before image showing the state before a skill is executed, an after image showing the state after the skill is executed. You are given a list of predicates below, and you are given the values of these predicates in the image before the skill is executed. Your job is to output the values of the following predicates in the image after the skill is executed. Pay careful attention to the visual changes between the two images to figure out which predicates change and which predicates do not change. Note that some or all of the predicates don't necessary have to change. First, output a description of what changes you expect to happen based on the skill that was just run, explicitly noting the skill that was run. Second, output a description of what visual changes you see happen between the before and after images, looking specifically at the objects involved in the skill's arguments, noting what objects these are. From these two descriptions, for each predicate labeled in the previous timestep, note whether you expect its value to change or stay the same. Next, output each predicate value in the after image as a bulleted list (use '*' for the bullets) with each predicate and value on a different line. Ensure there is a period ('.') after the truth value of the predicate. For each predicate value, provide an explanation as to why you labelled this predicate as having this particular value, and note what value this predicate had in the previous timestep, which is given to you in the prompt. Use the format: `* <predicate>: <truth_value>. <explanation>`. When labeling the value of a predicate, if you don't see the objects involved in that predicate, retain its truth value from the previous timestep. Also, if your description of changes you expect to happen, and your description of visual changes you saw happen, have nothing to do with the predicate you are trying to label, retain its truth value from the previous timestep. For example, if in the previous timestep I paint an object, and in the current timestamp I sit on it, we don't expect its color to change after sitting on it. 

Your response should have three sections. Here is an outline of what your response should look like:
[START OULTLINE]
# Expected changes based on the executed skill
[insert your analysis on the expected changes you will see based on the skill that was executed]

# Visual changes observed between the images
[insert your analysis on the visual changes observed between the images]

# Predicate values in the after image
[insert your bulleted list of `* <predicate>: <truth value>. <explanation>`]
[END OUTLINE]
