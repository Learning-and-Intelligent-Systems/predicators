Sometimes your reasoning about the value of a predicate at the current timestep uses an incorrect value of that predicate in the previous timestep. Below, I give you give you the values of the predicates at the previous timestep once again. Please check your reasoning and provide a corrected version of your previous answer, if it needs correcting. Regardless of whether or not it needs correctly, your reply should be formatted exactly the same as the previous answer.
